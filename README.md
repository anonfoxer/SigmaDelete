A less racist, more thoruough, and faster version of a batch file that deletes the Sigma5 Client. 


# Which file should I use?


 - If your install of Sigma is in the default Minecraft install location (i.e. C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft)
 
You may use either file, `Sigma5DeleteSmall.bat` is just a signifigantly smaller file if you just want that one option to clean it from that one install location.

- If your install of Sigma is anywhere else other than the default Minecraft install location 

Use `SigmaDeleter.bat` and use the second option to clean your install.
